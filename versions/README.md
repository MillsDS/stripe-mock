# API Versions

When we update Stripe API versions across breaking changes we use data beneath this directory to simulate deprecated Stripe API's.

* 2015-10-16: This is not official data, it's versibon 2017-08-15 data edited to pass our legacy tests. YMMV.
* 2017-08-15: This is official data updated 2017-10-24.
